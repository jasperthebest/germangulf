          <ul>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum ynamism and a firm belief that anything is possible are the tenets that make our achievements substantial. Though our beginnings were modest, our unbridled resolve and confidence have driven our vision beyond boundaries.</p>
            <p>We firmly believe in a simple, straightforward approach and we endorse the traditional values of honesty, integrity and social conscience. These principles define the corporate character and we regard them as the fundamental to the enterprise performance and success.</p>
            <p>We embraced the UAE as a land of opportunity, progressive and visionary, and identified the region’s potential for industrial growth. We have built on our early beginnings as a modest engineering Company to align our progress with the Nation’s development and the Kelvin Group of three companies, of which German Gulf is the consulting arm, has prospered through even the most trying times. Our Group is also growing with the establishment of our Indian operation under the title of Downtown Engineering Consultants India Pvt Ltd which has its head office at Connaught Place in New Delhi, a branch office in Kochi and a registered office in London.</p>
